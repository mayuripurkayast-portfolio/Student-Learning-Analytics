## 6) 🎯 Business Problem – Key Questions Answered

This project solves the following **critical business questions**:

### 1️⃣ **Do students with the same total study hours behave differently based on consistency?**  
→ Yes. Engagement consistency is a stronger predictor of success than total study hours.

### 2️⃣ **Do students reduce activity gradually before dropping out?**  
→ Engagement decay is visible and can be detected early.

### 3️⃣ **Which courses appear active but have poor completion?**  
→ Courses with high average study hours but low completions are flagged as "silent disengagement" courses.

### 4️⃣ **Can learners be segmented by dropout risk before they fail?**  
→ A risk-scoring model highlights high, medium, and low-risk learners.

### 5️⃣ **Is frequent learning better than long study hours?**  
→ Frequent short sessions have a positive impact on completion.

### 6️⃣ **Which metrics should the business monitor weekly?**  
Recommended KPIs:
- Engagement consistency  
- Study days  
- Learning frequency  
- Weekly risk score changes

 ## 8) Results, Conclusion & Recommendations

### ✔ Results
- The machine learning model identifies dropout-prone learners with meaningful accuracy.  
- Engagement consistency is a strong predictor of course completion.  
- Derived behavior metrics (study hours, learning frequency, course days) improve insight quality.

### ✔ Conclusion
The combination of **Power BI analytics + Python ML** enables learning platforms to:
- Understand how learners behave  
- Detect when learners start disengaging  
- Identify who is at risk early  
- Support data-driven interventions  

### ✔ Recommendations
- Implement **weekly engagement monitoring** dashboards.  
- Introduce **personalized nudges** for learners with declining consistency.  
- Redesign courses showing **high time spent but low completion**.  
- Deploy **automatic early warning alerts** to instructors or course managers.

## 9) Future Work
- Hyperparameter tuning to improve ML model accuracy.  
- Deploy model via **API, Flask, or Streamlit web app**.  
- Add richer behavioral features such as login time, device usage, peak study hours.  
- Integrate database connections to build a **real-time Power BI dashboard**.  
- Explore additional ML algorithms like XGBoost, Logistic Regression, or SVM.
